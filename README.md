## Text Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple text encoder/decoder tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a specific set of encryption rules. The encryption keys used are as follows:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".

## Requirements

- This tool only supports lowercase letters.
- Special characters and accents should not be used.
- It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and vice versa.

## How to Use

1. Open the application or webpage.
2. Choose the desired operation: encryption or decryption.
3. Enter the text you want to process in the corresponding input field.
4. Click the "Encode" button to encrypt the text or the "Decode" button to decrypt it.
5. The result will be displayed on the screen.
6. To copy the encrypted or decrypted text, click the "Copy" button. This will copy the text to the clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it elsewhere.

### Example

To encrypt the word "gato", enter it in the input field and click the "Encode" button. The encrypted version, "gaitober", will be displayed. Similarly, if you enter "gaitober" and click the "Decode" button, the original word "gato" will be shown.

Please note that this tool operates strictly according to the specified encryption rules and limitations mentioned above.
